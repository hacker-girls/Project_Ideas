# Project_Ideas
### running list of project ideas before this weekend!

What kind of projects is everyone interested in? Feel free to throw out general or specific stuff, just to get an idea of where everyone stands.

## Resources
- https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter : quick front end guides! 

## Ideas
- Twitter API analysis?
 * analyzing political tweets (trending topics, if one party tends to tweet about [climate change, education, etc.] more, etc.)
 * when user tweets -> do something (make lights light up on arduino)
 * I thought this was cool = https://mashable.com/2012/07/24/londons-eye-twitter/#aLDXOgJeC5qm
 	> maybe something with twitter sentiments?
 	> detect if user is sad/happy based on tweets?
 * twitter just released all 320 gigs of russian troll tweet data -> web app to see degree of interaction between user and russian troll? visualization of total bot targets? 

- ok this doesnt have anything to do with nlp but maybe we could incorporate somehow: user inputs town/zip code (could use maps api) and web app outputs predicted level of pollution in the next ___ years. i think the hackgt theme is nature so could be relevant to the topic. 
  > data: https://www.kaggle.com/epa/epa-historical-air-quality, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data, https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/noaa-global-historical-climatology-network-daily

## Datasets
- https://theysaidso.com/api/   (random but could be fun)
- http://numbersapi.com/#42		(again random but could be fun)
- http://developer.nytimes.com/		(good for nlp)
- http://esapi.intellexer.com/		(good for nlp?? I'd have to do more research)
- http://www.geonames.org/export/	(not sure what we'd do with this, but cool data)
- national park service has a pretty solid api 

** found this github with a list of public apis! Check it out and see if any give you a project idea! https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
