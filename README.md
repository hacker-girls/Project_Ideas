# Project_Ideas
### running list of project ideas before this weekend!

What kind of projects is everyone interested in? Feel free to throw out general or specific stuff, just to get an idea of where everyone stands.

## Resources
- https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter : quick front end guides! 

## Ideas
- Twitter API analysis?
 * analyzing political tweets (trending topics, if one party tends to tweet about [climate change, education, etc.] more, etc.)
 * when user tweets -> do something (make lights light up on arduino)
 * I thought this was cool = https://mashable.com/2012/07/24/londons-eye-twitter/#aLDXOgJeC5qm
 	> maybe something with twitter sentiments?
 	> detect if user is sad/happy based on tweets?
 * twitter just released all 320 gigs of russian troll tweet data -> web app to see degree of interaction between user and russian troll? visualization of total bot targets? 

- ok this doesnt have anything to do with nlp but maybe we could incorporate somehow: user inputs town/zip code (could use maps api) and web app outputs predicted level of pollution in the next ___ years. i think the hackgt theme is nature so could be relevant to the topic. would be AI track using time series ML models
  > data: https://www.kaggle.com/epa/epa-historical-air-quality, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data, https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/noaa-global-historical-climatology-network-daily
  
- twitter: (i dont have developer account so no clue if this is how it works) web app finds biggest community issues by using nlp for tweets that were sent close by to user? Uses key words like: wish, fix, problem, etc. idk

- I like the theme of the hackathon - Adventure. Maybe we could go along that theme? Not sure how yet, I'll keep thinking of ideas for a mobile app
	> Image processing for images of natural places/things
	> "Choose your own adventure" type quesions and output a national park or country suggestion to visit
	> Use NPS API: take in "ideal" parts of a vacation and output: National Park, suggested camping, news articles related to the park, suggested itinerary, permits needed, etc.
	
- I also like the idea of building off the adventure theme, and of doing something related to pollution/climate change (super relevant topic right now).  I have experience with using map apis/JS frameworks and building interactive maps so that's something I would be super interested in doing!  Related to Twitter sentiments we could do something like mapping sentiments about climate change in different areas or how often climate change is talked about around the world, or I like the idea of doing predictions of pollution over time -maddie

## Datasets
- https://theysaidso.com/api/   (random but could be fun)
- http://numbersapi.com/#42		(again random but could be fun)
- http://developer.nytimes.com/		(good for nlp)
- http://esapi.intellexer.com/		(good for nlp?? I'd have to do more research)
- http://www.geonames.org/export/	(not sure what we'd do with this, but cool data)
- national park service has a pretty solid api 

** found this github with a list of public apis! Check it out and see if any give you a project idea! https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
